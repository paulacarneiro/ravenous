# Ravenous

Ravenous was a guided 4-part react project from Codecademy's Web Development skill path. The goal of the project was to create a Yelp-like clone that allows users to search for businesses in specific locations. The four parts were:
1. Creating Static Components
2. Passing Information to Components
3. Setting the State of Ravenous Components
4. Interacting with the Yelp API

## Future

- Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
- Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
- <s>Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again</s> (done)
- Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
- Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input
